        After spending over a decade in media sales, first starting in
        Television ad ops I found an interest in development when I moved to
        digital advertisments. From here the interest further expanded during my
        time on the data team at theWeatherNetwork. Seeing the work and
        environment the developers spent their days in drove me to make the
        leap. I enrolled in the Lighthouse Labs bootcamp in late 2021 and
        completed the full course in August 2022. From then on I've been working
        to improve and expand my learnings as a developer with different
        languages and experiences.
